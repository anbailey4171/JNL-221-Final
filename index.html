      <p>The New York Climate Act has not increased clean-energy development in the “frontline and underserved communities” the state wanted to help transition to greener sources of energy in Onondaga County.</p>

      <p>The majority of solar panels that have been built are not within areas New York State has designated “Disadvantaged Communities.” After reviewing data from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), there are 158 commercial solar projects in Onondaga County that have been built or are being built since 2000 within disadvantaged communities, or about 11% of all solar projects. This is compared to 1312 commercial projects that have been developed outside disadvantaged communities.</p>

      <p>35% of New York State is considered a disadvantaged community. This designation was made after the New York State Climate Act was passed and officials wanted guidance on how to work with communities that “frontline and otherwise underserved communities benefit from the state’s historic transition to cleaner, greener sources of energy, reduced pollution and cleaner air, and economic opportunities,” according to NYSERDA’s website. </p>

      <p> Communities were designated as disadvantaged communities after the Climate Justice Working Group identified 45 indicators that would establish whether a community would be considered a disadvantaged community. These indicators included environmental issues, like  “proximity to power generation facilities” as well as “population characteristics and health vulnerabilities,” according to New York state. </p>

      <p> Since the Climate Act was signed in 2019, there have been 565 solar projects that have been approved by NYSERDA in Onondaga County. 107 of those projects have been made within disadvantaged communities or 18.9% of all projects approved since 2019. While this is an increase in how many solar panels are being produced, the vast majority of money is going to projects outside of disadvantaged communities. </p>

      <p> NYSERDA publishes the amount of money they give to projects as incentive to produce clean energy. Both in sum and on average, NYSERDA gives more money to projects outside of disadvantaged communities in Onondaga County, with the office giving projects within disadvantaged communities $6,003,599.35 and those outside of disadvantaged communities $87,988,769.17. On average, this comes to $37,997.46 per project within disadvantaged communities and $67,064.61 per project outside of disadvantaged communities. </p>

      <p> However the NYSERDA claims that this has more to do with contractors choosing to not go through NYSERDA to create their projects. NYSERDA Senior Communications Manager Theresa Smolen said that “NYSERDA’s Clean Energy Siting team and Large-Scale Renewables team coordinate with towns hosting large-scale renewable projects when and if they seek NYSERDA funding by participating in a competitive solicitation.” </p>

      <p> Along with the disparity in displacement, there is also a gap in the amount of energy that will be produced by these projects. On average, one project built within a disadvantaged community will be expected to produce 94,674.40 kWh, while those built outside a disadvantaged community will be producing 290,042.46 kWh. While there are practical reasons for this, like space, this still places disadvantaged communities at a disadvantage for hiring purposes. </p>

</script>

      <p>Also interesting about the data is the fact that there is a clear correlation between how much money is spent on a project and how much energy will be produced. In fact, for projects within a disadvantaged community, for every one dollar spent on any given project, that will lead to .56 kWh. Another way to understand this is .56 kilowatts per dollar spent. For projects outside of disadvantaged communities, this number is .55 kWh, almost exactly the same. </p>
